# integration-test-ex

for this exercies i made a simple javascript program for loan applications. The system contains 3 self-contained modules:
- PersonBase, a module for storing bank-users and their details
- AccountBase, a module for storing financial information on users
- LoanCalculator, a module for calculating possible loans for users based on their details and account info


I went with the "Big Bang" test approach where i tested all the modules in combination in one go, testing the interaction between the modules.

The results:
